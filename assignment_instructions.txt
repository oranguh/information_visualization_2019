In this assignment you will use your JavaScript and D3 skills to create standalone data-driven visualization with event handling.
All of the elements below have been covered in our hands on practical session on D3.

Assignment

Assume you were contacted by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI).
They have a dataset of daily temperature measurements on the Schiphol Airport in the period (2011 - 2015)
and they want to visualize the average monthly temperatures of each year in a bar chart.
They have provided the dataset (meteo.csvPreview the document), your task is to provide this visualization.

A complete solution contains the following elements:

1. Written completely in D3

2. Loads and uses the weather data from the provided CSV file

3. Each year represented by 12 bars for each month with each bar's size corresponding to the average temperature in said month

4. Month labels below the bars

5. Labels displaying the temperature at the top of each bar

6. The size of each bar is computed dynamically using D3 scale

7. Dynamically computed y-axis on the left-hand side

8. A label showing the current year 9.
The user can navigate through years by pressing the left arrow (previous year) or right arrow (next year);
pressing an arrow toggles update of the year label and recomputing of the bars and axes.

Download the dataset on the following link: meteo.csvPreview the document
